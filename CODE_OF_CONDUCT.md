# Kaamiki Code of Conduct

We want everyone to progress in an ecosystem that empowers developers to reach their potential â€” one that encourages growth and effective collaboration. A space that is safe for all.

A space such as this benefits everyone that participates in it. It encourages new developers to learn and enter our field. It is through discussion and collaboration that we grow, and through growth that we improve.

In the effort to create such a place, we are building our Code of Conduct. We do not publish this code because we fear inappropriate behavior, but because we already appreciate and love the extraordinary respect and values of our team.

 We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, harassment-free and healthy environment for everyone, regardless of level of experience and education.


As community members, contributors and maintainers of this project, we are thankful and commit to respect all people who participate in the community through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.


## Our standards

- We welcome and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining and we sacredly believe in the concept of *Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam* (Entire world is a family) in letter and spirit . Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to treat everyone well.

- (add : AIM of kaamiki in two points)


### Expected behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Clearly convey what you want, avoid acronyms and jargon if not everyone can understand in conversation. Be inclusive

- Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving Kaamiki.

- Don't just support your colleagues on demand, be proactive. Offer your help if you notice that a team member is struggling with a problem or otherwise needs help. Be careful not to be too patronizing or disrespectful. When someone turns to you for help, always be open, listen and try to put yourself in the position of your counterpart. If you don't have time because of a deadline, let the person know and tell them openly when you have time or maybe refer a team member who is just as familiar with the topic.

- Share your insights early to get feedback quickly. Don't just ask for feedback, but also give it back to the team. Your feedback should be friendly, respectful, clear, constructive, and focused on goals and values rather than personal preferences. Thank you for the feedback.

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people. Be polite and friendly in all forms of communication. Avoid sarcasm or explicitly add a #sarcasm hashtag to your statement to avoid misunderstandings. If required use Emojis or GIFs to avoid miscommunication in written form of communication, but don't tend to communicate only in pictures, but use them consciously and moderately.

- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences

- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience

- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
  
- Step down respectfully. Members of every team/project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of those who continue to participate in the project and should not misrepresent the project's goals or achievements. Likewise, community members should respect any individual's choice to leave the project.

*Do whatever you want to achieve our goal. Just mind the consequences.*

### unacceptable behavior include:

- Don't be surprised if a team member is not yet familiar with a topic, a tool, a person or a process. We believe in the spirit of a beginner and in the fact that one constantly wants to learn something new. It is absolutely okay to say "I don't know" or "I don't understand". The phrase "there are no stupid questions" is lived 100% by us.

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances of any kind

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

- Public or private harassment

- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

*Please, also take a notice that different people understand unacceptable behavior differently.*

## Scope

- We believe that the mutual articulation of our values and responsibilities gives us a clear direction if there are any deviations in the future. We are all committed to implementing and developing this Code of Conduct as our team (and customer base) grows.
  
- The Code of Conduct applies in particular to team interaction, including all events hosted/conducted by Kaamiki, chat and video conferences, social media communication, pull request feedback, participation in open source projects, communication with our team (and customers) and at conferences or events where we represent Kaamiki, whether offline or online.

## Conflict Resolution

*If the behavior is harassing or threatening, or for other reasons requires immediate actions, please see below reporting voilations section.*

 Conflict is a struggle that can arise during an active disagreement of opinions or interests. Many of us might fear conflict. However conflict is also a healthy, It means that people are learning to both stand up for their beliefs and compromise on some matters.
 
 Conflict can happen in any forms, from someone using hurtful and harsh language to more serious cases such as threats of voilence and everything in between.

Angry responses are valid, but abusive language and vindictive actions are toxic. When something happens that offends you, handle it assertively, but be respectful. Escalate reasonably, and try to allow the offender an opportunity to explain themselves, and possibly correct the issue.

Address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, preferably in a real-time medium. If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend). If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.
  
## Reporting Violations 

- If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact us by submitting an incident report[add link of google form made via kaamiki email], or email (add kaamiki email).

- If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.
  
- We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

- In order to provide learning & growth oriented space with protection of individual and Kaamiki community from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. The Kaamiki team are not here to explain power differentials or other basic social justice concepts to you. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.


## Enforcement Guidelines

- Kaamiki maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

- A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

- If a participant engages in harassing or any other serious behavior, the Kaamiki team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Kaamiki spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Kaamiki community members or the general public.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

Thank You !
